# 🛰️ Deforestation Viewer

Welcome to the **Deforestation Viewer** — a Python-based geospatial application that visualizes vegetation change (NDVI) from **1985–2024** using imagery from **Landsat 5/7/8/9** and **Sentinel-2** via Microsoft’s Planetary Computer.

This project automates:
- 🌍 **Downloading** satellite imagery for a chosen Area of Interest (AOI)  
- 🌱 **Computing NDVI composites** across decades  
- 🧭 **Visualizing change** interactively in Streamlit
