# 🗺️ Creating a Custom Area of Interest (AOI)

This guide explains how to define your own AOI for the Deforestation Viewer.

## 1. Install QGIS
Download and install QGIS from [https://qgis.org](https://qgis.org).

## 2. Draw Your AOI
1. Open QGIS and create a new project.
2. Use the **Polygon tool** to outline your desired area (forest, city, etc.).
3. Save the layer as a **GeoJSON file**.

## 3. Ensure the Correct CRS
Make sure your file is in **EPSG:4326 (WGS84)** coordinates:
- Right-click the layer → “Export” → “Save Features As…”  
- Set CRS to `EPSG:4326`

## 4. Place the AOI File
Move the resulting file into: `data/aoi/roi.geojson`.

Your directory should look like:
data/
└── aoi/
└── roi.geojson
## 5. Run the Pipeline
```bash
MAX_SCENES=None MAX_CLOUD=80 WINDOW_WEEKS=8 DAY_GAP=10 python src/search_download.py
```
